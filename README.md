# Refactoring CSS  Final Project with JS, SASS, Gulp

There is the last project that I made on clearly HTML + CSS.
I really upgrade my CSS Grid, Flex, Animation and Adaptive layout skills doing this work.

Now I'm learning JS and refactor this project using it. I'm validating form using jQuery here.
Also, I rewrite styles using SASS and set up automatic pipeline with updating and minifying output CSS file using Gulp.

Made on ITLogia Frontend Development course.
